= Workbenches


// Description
// What is a Workbench? Why do you need it?
// Describe the concept of a workbench and why you need it

In RHODS, a _workbench_ is a containerized working environment that runs as any other application in OpenShift, as a pod.
Workbenches typically include a collection of common AI/ML libraries and a JupyterLab server.
RHODS exposes the JupyterLab URL through an OpenShift route so that you can use and interact with the workbench via the web browser.

Data science projects can include more than one workbench.
This is useful when you need to run different experiments that belong to the same project, but with different tooling.
For example, you might want to train a simple model with Scikit-learn and another model with PyTorch.
Or you might have a workbench only for data exploration and another workbench for model training.

== Exercise: Getting Started with Workbenches

=== Creating Workbenches

Create a data science project (or use an existing one) and navigate to the project dashboard page.

From this page, click btn:[Create workbench].
In the workbench creation page, enter the workbench name, select the workbench image, and the image version.
For this particular example, use the recommended version of the `Minimal Python` image.

[NOTE]
====
The requirements of your project dictate the image that best suits your needs.
For example, if you plan to use TensorFlow, then you might want to select the `TensorFlow` image.
You can view more details about the selected image by clicking btn:[View package information].
====

Next, select the workbench container size and the number of GPUs.
Select `Tiny` and 0 GPUs in this case.

=== Define Environment Variables
// Workbench env vars - what? How? why?

Environment variables are the recommended way to inject configuration into software applications.
In this way, the application, or in this case the RHODS workbench, is decoupled from the working environment.

Scroll down to the btn:[Environment variables] section and click btn:[Add variable].
Choose whether you want to create a ConfigMap or a Secret.
You can define multiple key/value pairs or upload a file.

image::workbench-variables.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Each ConfigMap or Secret can contain multiple key/value items.
To add more items to a ConfigMap or a Secret, click btn:[Add another key / value pair].
Alternatively, you can upload a file that includes multiple key/value pairs.
====

=== Add Storage

// Adding and deleting cluster storage to the workbench (You can add storage to the project as well as to individual workbenches)

Workbenches require persistent storage to ensure that your progress is not lost when you stop or remove the workbench.

Scroll down to the btn:[Cluster storage] section.
Verify that RHODS automatically selects the btn:[Create new persistent storage] option.
This is the default behavior.
RHODS creates a dedicated persistent storage for each workbench and mounts the storage in the root directory of the container.

Alternatively, you can select an already existing storage.
The existing storage must not be associated with any other workbench.

You can adjust the storage size, which by default is 20 GiB.

image::workbench-storage.png[]

[NOTE]
====
You can also create persistent storage items from the data science project page, and leave the storage unassigned.
This is useful to create persistent storage that you plan to mount in workbench directories different from `/`.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot decrease the storage size of storage that is associated to a workbench.
====

[NOTE]
====
You cannot delete a storage item if it is assigned to a workbench.
The storage must be unassigned if you want to delete it.
====

=== Create the Workbench

Scroll down to the bottom of the page.

The btn:[Data connections] lets you inject S3 connection parameters into your workbench.
Leave this section unchanged.
Data connections are covered later in the course.

Click btn:[Create workbench].
RHODS triggers the creation of the workbench and redirects you to the data science project page.
While RHODS is provisioning the workbench, the workbench displays with the `Starting...` status.

image::workbench-starting.png[]

If the workbench creation is successful, you should see the workbench running in the project dashboard.

image::workbench-started.png[]

=== Inspect the Workbench

After you create the workbench, RHODS redirects you back to the data science project, where the workbench is listed.
To view more details about the workbench, click the btn:[>] icon.
A card displays that shows the workbench details, including storage usage.
You can use the btn:[Add storage] button to add more storage mount points.

image::workbench-view.png[]

=== Open the workbench

Click btn:[Open].
On the browser tab that opens, enter your credentials to authenticate to the workbench's JupyterLab.
Next, allow the selected permissions to access Jupyter lab.
Click btn:[Allow selected permissions].

image::workbench-auth.png[]

Verify that you see the JuypterLab application:

image::jupyterlab-home.png[]


=== Starting and stopping workbenches

RHODS can start and stop workbenches without losing data.

Return to the project page.
Click the btn:[Status] switch of the workbench to stop it.
Similarly, when the workbench is stopped, toggle the switch to start the workbench.


=== Edit the Workbench

Click the workbench btn:[⋮] button, then click btn:[Edit workbench].

Switch the image to `Standard Data Science` and click btn:[Update workbench].


[WARNING]
====
Make sure that you save your work at JuypterLab before updating a workbench.

When you edit a workbench, RHODS restarts the workbench, so any unsaved work will be lost.
====


=== Delete the Workbench

From the project dashboard, click the workbench btn:[⋮] button, then click btn:[Delete workbench].
In the delete window, type the workbench name to confirm the operation:

image::workbench-delete.png[]

[NOTE]
====
Deleting a workbench does not delete the associated persistent storage.
This means that you can create a new workbench and restore the data that you were using in the previous workbench.
====


== Workbench Resources

RHODS internally defines workbenches as stateful applications.
When you create a workbench, RHODS creates a StatefulSet in the OpenShift namespace that corresponds to your data science project.
The StatefulSet manages a pod that includes two containers:

* The workbench container, which contains JupyterLab and other packages.
* The `oauth-proxy` container, which provides authorization and authentication to access JupyterLab.

RHODS also creates the required services and routes to enable HTTP and HTTPS traffic into the workbench container.
If you list the resources of your OpenShift namespace that corresponds to your data science project, you should see something similar to this:

[subs=+quotes]
----
NAME                       READY   STATUS    ..
*pod/my-first-workbench-0*   2/2     Running   ..

NAME                             TYPE        ...
service/modelmesh-serving        ClusterIP   ...
*service/my-first-workbench*       ClusterIP   ...
*service/my-first-workbench-tls*   ClusterIP   ...

NAME                                  READY  ...
*statefulset.apps/my-first-workbench*   1/1    ...

NAME                                         ...
*route.route.openshift.io/my-first-workbench*  ...
----

Creating a new persistent storage in RHODS results in the creation of a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in the corresponding OpenShift project.

[NOTE]
====
If you delete the PVC of a storage assigned to a running workbench, then the PVC switches to `Terminating` until you stop the workbench.
====


== Permissions
To enable workbench access to other users, you must grant permissions to those users at the data science project level.
RHODS does not offer workbench-level permission management.






== Limits

If your memory and/or GPU requirements are high, then RHODS might not be able to allocate the requested resources in the workbench.
You might see a message similar to the following:

image::workbench-insufficient-resources.png[]

In this case, try to decrease your resource requirements by editing the workbench, or contact your RHODS administrator.
