= Data Science Projects

In RHOAI, a _data science project_ is the preferred way to organize resources when working on an AI/ML application.
Similar to how you use projects in OpenShift for other workloads, you can use, and should use data science projects to organize the different elements that you need for your AI applications, such as workbenches, model servers, or persistent storage.

You can create and manage data science projects by using the RHOAI dashboard.

Internally, a data science project is an OpenShift project that contains specific labels to identify the project as a RHOAI-specific project,
for example:

[source,yaml,subs="+quotes"]
----
kind: Project
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: my-ai-project
  labels:
    kubernetes.io/metadata.name: my-ai-project
    *modelmesh-enabled: 'true'*
    *opendatahub.io/dashboard: 'true'*
    ...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Regular OpenShift projects are not shown in the RHOAI dashboard.

If you cannot use the RHOAI dashboard, for example because you are automating the creation of your projects, then make sure that the `opendatahub.io/dashboard: 'true'` label is included in the project definition.
This label identifies the project as a data science project.

Additionally, if you wish to use model serving in your project, then you must add the `modelmesh-enabled: 'true'` label.

== Exercise

=== Creating Data Science Projects

First, open the RHOAI dashboard.

In a web browser, navigate to the web console of your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift cluster.
You might need to enter your credentials to access the dashboard.

Click the applications menu in the top navigation bar of OpenShift,
then click btn:[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI].

To create a data science project, click btn:[Data Science Projects] in the left navigation pane.

In the btn:[Data science projects] page, click btn:[Create data science project].

In the modal window that opens, enter the name of the project as `cat-detection` and click btn:[Create].

You can optionally add a description and modify the OpenShift resource name for the project.

After you create the project, RHOAI opens the project dashboard page.

From this page you can manage the project components and the permissions.

=== Configure Access

By default, only the project owner and privileged users can access your projects in RHOAI.
However, you can add permissions for specific users and groups.

To configure permissions from a project dashboard page, click the btn:[Permissions] tab.

Here you can add users and groups, and specify their permissions.

=== Deleting Data Science Projects

To delete a data science project, navigate to the btn:[Data science projects] page.

Locate the project to be deleted and click its btn:[â‹®] button

Click btn:[Delete project].

Finally, type the project name to confirm the deletion.

// [Trevor] Include details about how to manage a DS project when Self Provisioning is disabled on a cluster (e.g. annotations on namespaces).
