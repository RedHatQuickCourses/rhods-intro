// TODO: we might want to complete remove this section (ask Ted)

In this chapter, you learned:

* RHODS helps teams bridge gap between data science and engineering, by operationalizing the lifecycle of AI projects.
* RHODS is based on the upstream open source OpenDataHub project.
* RHODS provides users with ready-to-use environments that include stable versions of the most common AI/ML tools.
* Users can seamlesly run training pipelines, deploy, and monitor their models in production environments.

== Next Steps

* Create data science projects and workbenches
* Using the features of workbenches and data science projects
* Using Jupyter notebooks in workbenches
