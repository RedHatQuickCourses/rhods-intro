= Conclusion

// TODO: we might want to complete remove this section (ask Ted)

In this chapter, you learned:

* RHOAI helps teams bridge gap between data science and engineering, by operationalizing the lifecycle of AI projects.
* RHOAI is based on the upstream open source Open Data Hub project.
* RHOAI provides users with ready-to-use environments that include stable versions of the most common AI/ML tools.
* Users can seamlessly run training pipelines, deploy, and monitor their models in production environments.

== Next Steps

* Create data science projects and workbenches
* Use the features of workbenches and data science projects
* Use Jupyter Notebook in workbenches
