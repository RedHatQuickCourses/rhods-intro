In this exercise, you will use RHOAI to train and evaluate a simple machine learning model, by using JupyterLab and other common ML libraries.

// Not understood the demo.

1. *Open the RHOAI dashboard.*

a. In a web browser, navigate to the Web Console of your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift cluster, and log in with cluster admin credentials.

b. Click the applications menu in the top navigation bar of OpenShift,
then click btn:[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI].

c. If prompted, log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift cluster admin credentials.


2. *Configure the workbench of your data science project.*
+
A RHOAI workbench is a containerized application that includes commonly used data science tools and libraries, such as JupyterLab, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
RHOAI provides you with a collection of workbench container images, each one preconfigured and tailored to a specific data science use case.

a. Click btn:[Data Science Projects] in the left sidebar.

b. Create a data science project.
+
Click btn:[Create data science project].
+
In the modal window that opens, enter a name and click btn:[Create].

[NOTE]
====
If you are using Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift from the developer sandbox, then a project is already created for you.
====

c. Click the newly created project.

d. In the project page, click btn:[Create workbench] and complete the form with the following values.
+
[cols="1,1"]
|===
|*Name*
|`intro`

|*Notebook image* - Image selection
|`TensorFlow`

|*Notebook image* - Version selection
|Select the recommended option
|===
+
Do not modify the default values of the rest of the fields. For example,

b. If prompted, log in with your Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift credentials.

c. Click btn:[Allow selected permissions] to grant the workbench access to your data science project.

d. Verify that the JupyterLab interface opens in a new browser tab.

e. Click the btn:[Git] icon in the left sidebar.

f. Click btn:[Clone a repository].
+

g. Enter https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps.git as the repository, and click btn:[Clone].

4. *Open and run the notebook.*

a. In the file explorer, navigate to the `rhods-qc-apps/1.intro/chapter1/intro-demo` directory.

b. To open the notebook, double click `notebook.ipynb`.
The notebook includes instructions and code.

c. Click the first cell, then press btn:[Shift+Enter] to execute the cell and move to the next one.

d. Execute and review the rest of the cells.
Keep pressing btn:[Shift+Enter] until you reach the bottom.


5. *Run the `intro-text-generation` notebook*

a. In the data science project dashboard, create a workbench with the default image for PyTorch.
// Need to add details such as name other settings.

b. In the new workbench, open JupyterLab and clone the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps.git repository as you did in the previous step.

c. Open the `rhods-qc-apps/1.intro/chapter1/intro-text-generation/notebook.ipynb` notebook in JupyterLab and execute the steps.
The instructions are embedded in the notebook.
