= Customizing Workbenches
:navtitle: Customizing

// Description
// Customize notebooks by installing third-party packages

RHOAI provides preconfigured notebook images to create workbenches.
Each of these images is designed to support your data science workflow in specific and popular technological stacks.
For example, if you plan to work with PyTorch, then you might want to use the `PyTorch` image.

The notebook image that you pick, however, might not include all the libraries that you need for your project.
You might need a library that is not included in any of the images, or you might need a different set of libraries.
Or perhaps, you just need a different version of a specific library, or even a different version of Python.

In this case, you have two options:

1. Create a workbench from the image that is closer to your needs and then install the required packages and versions in the workbench via JuypterLab.
2. Prepare a custom notebook image and add it to RHOAI.

This course covers the first option.
The second option is covered in the https://redhatquickcourses.github.io/rhods-admin/rhods-admin/1.33/index.html[Red{nbsp}Hat OpenShift AI Administration] course.

== Supported Notebook Images

RHOAI ships with a collection of notebooks images, which are optimized and supported by Red{nbsp}Hat and independent software vendors (ISVs).
These images are designed for data scientists, providing them with the necessary tools to start working quickly.
Moreover, Red{nbsp}Hat provides support for these images for atleast one year, and releases major versions of each image typically every six months.

By default, RHOAI includes these images:

[compact]
* CUDA
* Standard Data Science
* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* Minimal Python
* TrustyAI

// Explain what exactly is a notebook image that comes out of the box with RHOAI. Provide links to the Containerfile/Dockerfile for the images shipped with RHOAI
// References to the list of base container images provided by RHOAI - product docs links

These images are regular container images.
The source Dockerfiles for these images are available at the https://github.com/red-hat-data-services/notebooks/tree/main/jupyter[red-hat-data-services/notebooks] GitHub repository.

These images are also available in the Quay.io registry at https://quay.io/organization/modh.
RHOAI tracks these images by using ImageStreams that point to the notebook images available in Quay.
You can inspect the available images by running the following command:

== Exercise: Customizing Workbenches with JupyterLab

To use JupyterLab for customizing a workbench, follow these steps:

1. In a new or an existing data science project, create a `Standard Data Science` workbench.

2. In the project dashboard, click the btn:[>] icon of the workbench to expand its details.
Verify the list of packages included in the workbench.

3. Open the workbench.
In JupyterLab, clone the https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps repository.

4. Open the `1.intro/chapter3/customize/notebooks-customize.ipynb` notebook and follow the instructions.
