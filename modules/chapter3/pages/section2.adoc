= Creating, Importing and Collaborating on Notebooks
:navtitle: Git

In this section, you will learn how to create, import, and share notebooks by using a Git repository.

The RHODS workbench images add the  https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-git[Git] extension to JupyterLab.
This extension adds graphical controls to interact with Git repositories via the JuypterLab interface.

[NOTE]
====
If you prefer the command line, you can open a terminal and work directly with the `git` CLI.
====

== Exercise: Creating a Notebook

1. In a new or an existing RHODS data science project, create a `Minimal Python` workbench.

2. Open the JupyterLab interface of the notebook.

3. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Shift+L] to open a new launcher.

4. In the btn:[Notebook] section, click btn:[Python 3.9].

+
JuypterLab creates a new `Untitled.ipynb` notebook file.

5. Press kbd:[Ctrl+S] to save the notebook.
Enter a name for the notebook and click btn:[Rename].
+

+
You have now created your first notebook.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Before creating a notebook, verify that your are at the directory where you wish to create the notebook file.
Use the JupyterLab file browser to navigate to the right directory.

== Exercise: Importing a Notebook from Git

1. In the same JupyterLab window, click the Git icon.

2. Click btn:[Clone a repository].
+

3. Enter https://github.com/RedHatQuickCourses/rhods-qc-apps as the repository, and click btn:[Clone].

4. Navigate to any of the subdirectories of `rhods-qc-apps` and double click a notebook file to open it.


== Exercise: Creating a Notebook in a Git Repository

1. Create a public GitHub repository with your GitHub account.
Refer to https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo if you need help with this step.

2. Return to the JupyterLab window that you have used in the previous exercise.
Click the Git icon.

3. Click btn:[Clone a repository].
+

4. Enter the URL of your Git repository and click btn:[Clone].
+

5. In the file browser, navigate to the repository directory.

6. In this directory, create a notebook file called `hello.ipynb`.
You can follow the steps given in the first exercise of this page.

7. Add the following code in the first cell:
+
[source,python]
----
print("Hello world")
----

8. Press kbd:[Ctrl+Enter] to execute the cell.
Your notebook should display as follows:
+
image::hello-world-notebook.png[align="center"]

9. Press btn:[Ctrl+S] to save the notebook.
Alternatively, you can click menu:File[Save Notebook].

10. Click the Git tab in the side bar.
Git displays the newly added file:
+

11. Stage the `hello.ipynb` file.
Right click the file and click btn:[Track].
+
image::git-track-file.png[]
+
The file is now staged.
+

12. Enter the commit message and the description at the bottom, and click btn:[Commit].
+
image::git-commit-changes.png[]
+
At this point, JupyterLab prompts for the committer information.
Enter your name and email.

13. Push your changes to GitHub.
Click the btn:[up arrow cloud] icon at the top.
+
image::git-push-icon.png[]
+
At this point, JupyterLab requires you to authenticate into GitHub.
Enter your GitHub username and token.
+

14. Return to GitHub and verify that your repository contains the `hello.ipynb` file.
Notice that GitHub can render the notebook in view-only mode.


== Pulling Changes

To pull changes from a remote repository, you can use the btn:[down arrow cloud] icon.

If you have uncommitted changes in your workbench, then you might see a message indicating that your changes forbid pulling the changes, as follows:

image::git-forbid-changes.png[]

To solve this problem, commit your changes in the workbench before pulling.

After you have committed your changes in the workbench, you might still find problems.
For example, if the remote and the local branches have diverged, then you must configure the git strategy to reconcile the branches.
Open a terminal and run the following command to configure Git to merge branches:

[subs+=quotes]
----
git config pull.rebase false
----

Finally, you might occasionally find conflicts if multiple contributors are working on the same branch.
In that case, JupyterLab opens the _diff view_, which allows you to view the differences and solve the conflicts.

After you have solved the conflicts, click the btn:[Mark as resolved] button at the top right.
